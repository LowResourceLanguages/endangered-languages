# Contributing

Welcome to the endangered-languages list. Please feel free to contribute in any way you can: by submitting links, by engaging in discussions on the issues, and so on. All are welcome. This is a very open project.

If you're interested in discussing the list in some offline capacity, get in touch with @RichardLitt. I'd be more than happy to have a phone call or email exchange.

Please alphabetize any entries you add, and update the Table of Contents. Also, please make sure that links are valid. Thanks.
